h1. Installation

Transition.js is implemented in HTML and JavaScript, it depends on jQuery both for itself as well as for the web applications that it tests.

To get started, clone the Transition.js git repository:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/projects
$ git clone git@github.com:kyleburton/transition.js.git
{% endhighlight %}

In your project, symlink the `transition.js/public` directory within your Web application's document root:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/projects/my-project/web-root
$ ln -s ~/transition.js/public ./transition
{% endhighlight %}

You should then be able to browse to @/transition/index.html@ within your web application and see the test runner.

Implement your test suite in the file @test-suite.js@ in your Web application's document root.  Optionally create a @test-suite.html@ for any UI elements your _tests_ require and it will be automatically appended to the Test UI's @<body>@ by the framework.
