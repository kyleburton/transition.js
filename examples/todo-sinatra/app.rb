    # set of lists with a new list tab. The first list's tasks are displayed as
    # well.

    # This renders the same page as root but allows you to specify which list
    # is shown first. Doing this is kind of hacky, I'd like to have this get
    # request, but redirect it to root with an anchor link specifying which tab
    # should be shown. However, the tabbing library being used for the project
    # doesn't pick up on the anchor link itself, but rather appears to intercept
    # them. I would have to find a library which fixes this or fix it myself to
    # get the desired behavior. So for now I'll imitate the behavior of the
    # Rails 3 app.
